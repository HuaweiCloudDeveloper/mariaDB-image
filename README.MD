## Repository Introduction

[MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server) is an open-source relational database management system led by Michael Widenius, the founder of MySQL. It aims to offer full compatibility with MySQL while achieving faster development iterations and greater scalability. This product is based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers, offering out-of-the-box MariaDB.

## Core Features

- **Development Background**:
    - Emerged as a branch of MySQL to address the risk of closed-source after Oracle's acquisition of MySQL
    - Maintained by the MariaDB Foundation, under the GPLv2 license agreement
- **Technical Compatibility**:
    - Maintains binary compatibility with MySQL, supporting seamless migration
    - Compatible with MySQL's APIs, command lines, file formats, and connectors
- **Storage Engines**:
    - By default uses XtraDB (enhanced version of InnoDB) and Maria storage engines
    - Includes extended engines such as PrimeBase XT and FederatedX
- **Performance Advantages**:
    - 13%-22% better performance than MySQL in high-concurrency read-write scenarios
    - Natively supports Galera Cluster multi-master synchronous clusters
